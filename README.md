# deep_learning_causal_inference
My presentation in a Neural Networks course at EMAp - FGV. 

This repository contains my slides of a "Deep Learning for Causal Inference" seminar in a Neural Networks course, as well as a simple notebook (which I intend to further develop) trying to interpret the behavior of some architectures.
